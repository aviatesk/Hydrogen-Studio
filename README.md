# Atom Hydrogen-Studio

This is a plugin for Atom package [Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen) that makes it look more like [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop) or [Juno](https://junolab.org/).

- Note the package is currently under development and I'm very welcome to hear your ideas or have your PRs to make this plugin much better.
